                <li>
                  One member of each team faces the other in a face-off as the host reads the question off the game board.

                </li>
                <li>The team that buzzed in with the correct answer receives control of the board and has the option of playing or passing control to the other team.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The team that has the control tries to reveal all of the correct answers to the question before receiving three strikes.
                </li>

<li>If the team receives three strikes without clearing the board, control is passed to the other team.</li>
<li>The team that now has the control is able to give one answer in the hopes that it is found on the board.
</li>
<li>If it is, points are added to the team's score.
</li>
<li>If not, the other team gets the points.
</li>
<li>Points are collected as each team finds its answers to the question on the board.</li>
<li>Each team tries to collect the most points. The team with the most points wins the game!</li>
